Project 6 contains the assembler that translates programs written in the Hack assembly lanugage into binary code. To run the assembler in the command line, type ./main and the file name in which you would like to translate into binary code (./main max/max.asm). The driver file, parser.c, contains the assembler function. The assembler function will translate the hack assembly code into machine code.
